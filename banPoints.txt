This allows you to define point values to block types and if the
point max is exceeded, action is taken. For example if "offensePoints" is
set to 3, you could define breaking your diamond/gold/ore blocks as 3 points
and anyone breaking them insta-banned, whereas perhaps breaking the stone/wood
parts of your honeypot structure are only worth 1 point (the default) and
therefore they'd have to break 3 of them to get banned.  Long-term goal here
is to allow you to Honeypot an entire region (ala WorldGuard regions) but give
some fine-grain control so people aren't banned for hitting leaves or flowers
(which you could set to 0 points, or whatever makes sense for you and your
honeypot structure).
